# Microclaw PRD (v1)

- Status: Approved for planning
- Date: 2026-02-08
- Owner: mg
- Implementation language: TypeScript
- LLM runtime: Claude Agent SDK V2 preview

## 1. Product Summary
Microclaw is a local, single-user TypeScript bot that reimplements nanobot core flows for Telegram and Discord using the Claude Agent SDK V2 session model.

## 2. Objective
Deliver nanobot-style core behavior for:
- agent loop
- tool calling
- workspace management
- channels
- message handling

The first release focuses on reliable local operation and parity for core flows.

## 3. Primary User Story
As the bot owner, I send a Telegram message asking to summarize files in the workspace, and the bot reads workspace files and responds with a concise summary in the same channel.

## 4. Scope
### In Scope (v1)
- Telegram + Discord channel support.
- Reply to every inbound message.
- Text-only message handling.
- Per-channel conversation identity (`channel:chat_id`).
- Session persistence with only `conversation_key -> claude_session_id`.
- Configurable default workspace path.
- Full tool permissions for now.
- Local deployment/runtime only.
- Model locked to `claude-sonnet-4-5`.
- Tool set:
  - `read_file`
  - `write_file`
  - `edit_file`
  - `list_dir`
  - `exec`
  - `web_search`
  - `web_fetch`
  - `message`

### Out of Scope (v1)
- `spawn` subagents.
- cron/heartbeat features.
- media ingestion (voice/photo/document).
- multi-user or multi-tenant support.
- advanced compliance constraints.

## 5. Functional Requirements
1. Accept inbound messages from Telegram and Discord.
2. Normalize inbound events into one internal message format.
3. Resolve a conversation key per channel/chat.
4. Resume existing Claude session when available; otherwise create a new session.
5. Run the agent turn using Claude SDK V2 `send()` and `stream()`.
6. Execute requested tools and feed results back to the agent.
7. Send final text response to the same channel/chat.
8. Persist only the session mapping for future turns.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Local-first operation.
- Strong typing and modular boundaries.
- Idempotent handling where practical for message delivery retries.
- Structured logs suitable for local debugging.
- Minimal persisted user data (session map only).

## 7. Runtime/Platform Decisions
- Runtime: Node.js (local process).
- Deployment target: local machine only.
- No hard limits on latency/throughput/cost in v1.

## 8. High-Level Architecture
- `channels/`: Telegram and Discord adapters.
- `core/bus`: inbound/outbound event routing.
- `core/agent-loop`: orchestration loop.
- `core/claude-client`: SDK V2 wrapper (`createSession`, `resumeSession`, `send`, `stream`).
- `core/session-store`: persistent map of conversation key to session id.
- `core/tool-registry`: tool schema registration + dispatch.
- `tools/`: concrete tool implementations.
- `config/`: typed config loading and validation.

## 9. Data Model
`SessionMap` persisted to local JSON:

```json
{
  "telegram:123456": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc",
    "updatedAt": "2026-02-08T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

No transcript storage in v1.

## 10. Risks
- Claude SDK V2 is unstable preview and may change.
- Tool-calling behavior may require adapter updates during implementation.
- Full permissions increase operational risk by design (accepted for v1).

## 11. Success Criteria
- Telegram and Discord both respond to inbound text messages.
- Session continuity works across restarts through session map persistence.
- Workspace summarization scenario works end-to-end from Telegram.
- Core tools can be called and return results to the model loop.

## 12. Milestones
1. Freeze interfaces and config schema.
2. Implement channel adapters and internal bus.
3. Implement Claude session manager and agent loop.
4. Implement v1 tools and registry.
5. Validate with end-to-end local acceptance scenarios.
